# LLM-powered-Sentiment-Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using transformer-based models from Hugging Face (BERT and DistilBERT). The goal is to classify reviews as Positive or Negative.

---
## Project Objectives
- Build a complete sentiment analysis pipeline.
- Preprocess text and tokenize using pretrained Hugging Face tokenizers.
- Fine-tune transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT) for binary classification.
- Visualize training loss over epochs.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Save and load trained models for reuse.
