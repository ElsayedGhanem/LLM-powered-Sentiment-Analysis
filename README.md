# LLM-powered-Sentiment-Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using transformer-based models from Hugging Face (BERT and DistilBERT). The goal is to classify reviews as Positive or Negative.

---
## Project Objectives
- Build a complete sentiment analysis pipeline.
- Preprocess text and tokenize using pretrained Hugging Face tokenizers.
- Fine-tune transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT) for binary classification.
- Visualize training loss over epochs.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Save and load trained models for reuse.
---
##  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Google Colab)
- PyTorch – for model training and inference
- Hugging Face Transformers – for pretrained BERT models and tokenizers
- Datasets – to load IMDB dataset
- scikit-learn – for confusion matrix
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – for visualization
- NLTK – for basic text preprocessing

##   How to Upload Your Model to Google Colab

If you want to test your pretrained weights

from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

Load the model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('bert_sentiment_model.pth'))
model.eval()
